RE: ALIEN REGISTRATION CARD

GENTLEMEN:

PLEASE BE INFORM THAT ON MAY 27, 1968 I WENT
TO YOUR OFFICES AND HAD MY MEDICAL AND IMMIGRATION
EXAMINATION, BUT TO THIS DATE I HAVE NOT RECEIVED
MY ALIEN CARD. MY HUSBAND AND CHILDREN WENT
WITH ME ON THE SAME DAY AND THEY HAVE THEIR CARDS
MORE THAN THREE MONTHS AGO.

I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU BE GOOD ENOUGH TO
CHECK IN YOUR FILES DUE TO THE FACT THAT I MOVED
AND EVEN THOUGH I REPORTED MY NEW ADDRESS IT
MIGHT STILL BE IN YOUR FILES.

THANKING YOU IN ADVANCE FOR YOUR KIND ATTENTION
TO THIS MATTER, AND HOPING TO BE RECEIVING IT
SOON, I AM,

TRULY YOURS,

[Name redacted]


## About This Item

This letter was not authored or even typed by my grandmother. She did not speak English at this time (and spoke only a few phrases) after living in the United States for more than half of her adult life.
