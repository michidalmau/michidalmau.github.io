shortdesc:	Mima showing me her altar where she venerates family members who have died. This is in 2001 right before they were to sell their long-time home in Hialeah, my childhood second-home, and move in with one of their kids. At the end of the video, I ask her in Spanish: "— ¿Qué vas a hacer con esto cuando te mudes?" To which she replied, in Spanish, "Ay, fígurate tú, mi hija, yo no sé dónde le voy a meter, ¡por Dios!"
