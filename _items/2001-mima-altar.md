shortdesc:	Altars have always been the way my grandmother honors family who have died. This is just one of many incarnations of her altar, but this one would be the last one in her long-time home, and my childhood second-home. In this clip she's walking me through aspects of the altar. Spoiler. She is very excited about the flowers!
