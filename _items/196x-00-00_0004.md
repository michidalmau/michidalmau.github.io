shortdesc: Every year on September 8 my grandmother would celebrate la Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre, her nameksake, and the patron saint of Cuba. This alter was setup in their New Jersey home before I was born. When I was growing up in the mid 1970s to the late 1990s, I would join the gathering of friends and family who would light a candle and celebrate with my grandmother.
