My parents were born in Cuba. They emigrated to the United States in the 1960s as adolescents, in response to the Cuban Revolution that was brewing since early 1950s and came to fruition 1959. Revolutionary Cuba, they learned was not a Cuba that valued freedom of speech and self-determination. In the pursuit of liberty and opportunity, my parents, and their parents left their home and made a new one in Miami, Florida. 

This digital archive is meant to not only document their histories, but also to create a space in which I explore my Cuban identity, caught between two countries and rife with propaganda on both sides. There is no one way. No one truth. As people in Cuba / from Cuba are known to say, “it’s complicated.” This is my attempt to surface the contradictions and embrace them as I navigate two worlds.
